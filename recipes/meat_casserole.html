        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive oil spray - for pan</li>
            <li>2 pounds extra lean ground beef - 93% lean</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>4 ounces reduced-fat cream cheese - cubed</li>
            <li>1 cup cheddar - shredded, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons parsley - chopped for garnish</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 400°F. Lightly spray a 2-quart casserole dish with olive oil and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a large 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Lightly spray it with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet. Cook, stirring and breaking up the meat into small pieces, until the meat is no longer raw, about 5 minutes. Drain the beef and return it to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Mix the salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne into the beef, then slowly and patiently mix in the cream cheese until fully melted and incorporated.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat off, and mix ½ cup of the shredded cheddar into the beef mixture.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup of cheddar on top.</li>
            <li>Bake the casserole until the cheese is melted, about 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
        </ol>
