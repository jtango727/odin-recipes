        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>4 large bell peppers</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small onion finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 lb lean ground beef</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons keto taco seasoning</li>
            <li>1 15 oz can diced tomatoes in their juices</li>
            <li>1 cup cauliflower rice steamed</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheese divided</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F. Lightly grease a large baking dish.</li>
            <li>Slice the tops of the bell peppers off, and de-seed them, and remove excess membranes. Slice each bell pepper in half and place them in the lined dish. </li>
            <li>In a large non-stick pan, heat up your olive oil on medium. When hot, add your onions and sautee for around one minute. Add your ground beef and cook until no longer pink. Add the taco seasoning then pour in the can of diced tomatoes along with the juices. Let simmer for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the steamed cauliflower rice and one cup of shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Evenly distribute the filling amongst the bell pepper halves and top with remaining cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake the stuffed peppers for 20-25 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the bell peppers are tender. </li>
            <li>Remove the stuffed peppers from the oven and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
